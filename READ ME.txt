Trackbuilder

its not noob friendly so an litle explanation

be sure ad a trackpiece to the current track, do not place it random
the trackpiece has an green and red rectangle, 

green: goes in the trackpiece
red : means goes out of the track piece, 

so the last tile has an red square for going out so you new trackpiece must connect to it with an green square

when finished with the track (it reconnects to start), save it

you can ignore this but then you gameplay wil be fucked up

-----copy paste the startpos and test file in the assets to get a nice working track ( just in case ;)  )

gameplay:

up to 4 players
al players can be human or ai
be sure to set the controls otherwise you cant drive


-- bombs :
- can give you a boost and stall others
- can activate other bombs
